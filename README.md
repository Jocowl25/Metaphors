# Metaphors - Sylvia Plath
I’m a riddle in nine syllables, <br>
An elephant, a ponderous house,<br>
A melon strolling on two tendrils.<br>
O red fruit, ivory, fine timbers!<br>
This loaf’s big with its yeasty rising.<br>
Money’s new-minted in this fat purse.<br>
I’m a means, a stage, a cow in calf.<br>
I’ve eaten a bag of green apples,<br>
Boarded the train there’s no getting off.<br>
